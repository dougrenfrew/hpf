Run configure.sh in the mcm directory which will replace all occurences 
of "DB_HOME" in the rosetta and mammoth path files with the first argument, ie the tmp database directory.

This will unzip and untar the rosetta++ code.  
You'll need to build rosetta++, and the mcm script will look for it in 
this directory as "rosetta++"

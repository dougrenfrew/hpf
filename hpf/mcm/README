dpb, 05/30/2012:
Completely new, fully functional MCM process (whole thing, from clustering to mammoth
to MCM) is being written in 'new_mcm.py'.
Code has been moved out of task chain structure, and instead made more modular (with
components going into appropriate modules) and procedural.

dpb, 12/16/2010:
IMPORTANT NOTE: mcm.py is the old wrapper for the perl script with MCM functionality.
The most current MCM functionality (re-written by PW) is in process.py, which is driven by
scripts/remcm.py:

https://err.bio.nyu.edu/svn/hpf/hpf/trunk/src/hpf/hddb/mcm/process.py
https://err.bio.nyu.edu/svn/hpf/hpf/trunk/src/hpf/hddb/mcm/scripts/remcm.py

This code uses task chaining for organization of functionality (different from task pool
structure).


PW, ??:
You can probably disregard most of the things here.  A lot of these scripts were 
inherited, one way or another, and should probably be cleaned up.

However, the robetta clustering mod and the mammoth mod are both important.  
The mammoth mod contains a patch that computes contact order.

    compute average secondary structure prediction and maintain ratio

    replace linked list sort with heap sort

nnmake-v1_2
   add loop picking capability
   add jufo secondary structure prediction

nnmake-v1_1
   replace jones 1 state with jones 3 state, add corrected jones 1 state
   reset the quotas for different frag selection schemes
   code cleanup: change ss_type indexing, add named variables for types
   frags tagged with version ('v1_1')

nnmake-v1_0      casp4 version
   oddities-- uses jones 1 state prediction; treats confidence
              as probability, so forces frags with the wrong 
              secondary structure when the prediction is wrong
           -- no profile only fragments
   frags taged with 'new_d' on end
